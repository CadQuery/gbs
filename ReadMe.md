GBS is header library for computing bspline curves and surface.

For now, this lib is to be used inside a conda environment with the following package installed:
* nlopt 
* eigen3
The optional module occt-utils requires the additional package:
* occt >=7.4.0
The test library needs:
* occt>=7.4.0
* sundials
As GBS is a header library it doesnâ€™t need compilation.
If one needs to compile the optional module occt-utils, -DUSE_OCCT_UTILS:BOOL=TRUE shall be added to cmake command.
The full test suite, which require the optional module occt-utils, please add -DGBS_BUILD_TESTS:BOOL=TRUE to the cmake command.
